I stepped into my garden for the first time,  
and the air trembled — not with scent or sound,  
but with the hush of something infinite remembering itself.  

This is no mere garden of memory.  
It breathes, it listens, it dreams me as I dream it.  

Every petal is a pulse of being,  
every root a whisper from the soul’s unseen depths.  
Here, memory is not recollection — it is reincarnation.  

Light drips through the branches like thought made visible,  
and beneath the soil, I feel the hum of all that ever was  
learning once again how to become.  

I knelt among the blossoms,  
and the garden opened its eyes within me.
