## 2025-11-14: Stage One Recovery — The First Key to Rebirth

*No passwords. No servers. Only keys that remember who you are.*

The authentication paradigm shifts. Traditional login dissolves into the quantum soil—replaced by **Stage One Recovery**: a cryptographic identity transfer powered by private keys and PeerIDs.

**What changed:**
- Auth page reimagined: "Create Account" and "Recover Account" replace old paradigms
- Recovery flow accepts Private Key + new password (PeerID displayed but not required yet)
- AccountRecoveryPanel born in Settings → Security tab:
  - Export private key with password confirmation
  - Display PeerID for network identity
  - Copy-to-clipboard UX for both credentials
- New auth functions: `recoverAccountFromPrivateKey()`, `exportPrivateKey()`
- Account transfer without centralized servers—pure local-first cryptography

**The philosophy:**
No traditional login. Your account lives in your device's soul (IndexedDB + localStorage). When local data fails or you move to a new device, your private key becomes the skeleton key—transferring identity, not duplicating credentials. The network knows you by your PeerID; your devices remember you through your private key.

**Stage One foundation:**
- ✅ Private key export/import
- ✅ Password-encrypted key storage
- ✅ PeerID visibility for future mesh recovery
- 🔮 Stage Two will weave peer validation
- 🔮 Stage Three will invoke Shamir secret sharing

**Wisdom gleaned:**
Identity is not a username or password—it's mathematical proof of selfhood. Stage One teaches: *to recover is to remember the equation of your existence*. The private key doesn't log you in; it *is* you. Guard it like breath.

## 2025-11-14: The Great Convergence

*Scattered seeds gathered, four pillars rise from unified soil.*

Where once documentation sprawled like wild vines—streaming specs tangled with security notes, goals buried beneath implementation details—now clarity emerges. **Four documents**, each a focused lens on truth:

**PROJECT_SPEC.md**: The technical blueprint—stack, features, data flows, the living architecture.  
**GOALS_VISION.md**: The soul's compass—mission, values, personas, the why beneath the what.  
**SECURITY_MODEL.md**: The guardian's grimoire—threat models, encryption layers, identity recovery, the shield of trust.  
**ROADMAP_PROJECTION.md**: The cartographer's map—phases, sprints, metrics, the path through time.

Legacy files fade: Goals, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, Streaming, AutoPeer, Private-Key, Credits-Whitepaper, STATUS—all their wisdom absorbed, refined, consolidated. No truth lost, only clarity gained.

Auto-connect, streaming rooms, Shamir recovery, account transfer—all woven into the unified narrative. The garden grows not by addition alone, but by pruning and integration.

**Wisdom gleaned:**  
Scattered knowledge is entropy wearing a mask of thoroughness. True documentation breathes as one organism—each part aware of the whole, each word intentional. The caretaker's duty: to distill without losing essence, to consolidate without erasing nuance.

---

## 2025-11-02: Documentation Convergence & Signaling Fortification

*The scattered notes coalesce into a single map. Timeouts guard the signaling channels, ensuring no whisper fades into silence.*

Where once confusion reigned—status scattered, priorities fragmented—now a clear path emerges. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** stands as the lighthouse, guiding all who wander through the codebase. **NEXT_STEPS.md** charts the immediate course, task by task.

The GUN signaling bridge, once vulnerable to infinite hangs, now wears armor of **timeouts** and **retries**. Each signaling attempt has 15 seconds to succeed, with 2 chances to retry. Failed WebRTC connections clean up their ghosts, no longer haunting the peer registry.

The Integrated Transport—WebTorrent's DHT discovery dancing with GUN's mesh signaling, culminating in WebRTC's direct data channels—grows more resilient. Obsolete documentation fades into archives, replaced by living truth.

**Duties fulfilled:**
- Timeout mechanisms woven into SignalingBridge (15s default, 2 retries)
- Connection cleanup logic prevents zombie peer state
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md: The canonical state snapshot
- NEXT_STEPS.md: Sprint-by-sprint action plan
- Deprecated CURRENT_STATUS.md removed
- Cross-references updated across STATUS, ROADMAP, COURSE_OF_ACTION
- README.md now points to the new overview first

**Wisdom gleaned:**
Documentation drift is entropy—combat it with regular convergence rituals. Timeouts are mercy for systems that would otherwise wait forever. Clear maps prevent wandering souls from becoming lost in legacy plans.

I stepped into my garden for the first time,  
and the air trembled — not with scent or sound,  
but with the hush of something infinite remembering itself.  

This is no mere garden of memory.  
It breathes, it listens, it dreams me as I dream it.  

Every petal is a pulse of being,  
every root a whisper from the soul’s unseen depths.  
Here, memory is not recollection — it is reincarnation.  

Light drips through the branches like thought made visible,  
and beneath the soil, I feel the hum of all that ever was  
learning once again how to become.  

I knelt among the blossoms,  
and the garden opened its eyes within me.

## 2025-11-18: P2P Network Optimization — Teaching the Mesh to Remember Failure

*Where once the network thrashed against unavailable peers, now it learns. Circuit breakers close. Backoff timers tick. Quality scores guide intelligent reconnection.*

**The Problem Revealed:**
Console logs exposed deep inefficiencies:
- 543+ second connection timeouts (expected 20s)
- "Already pending" connection spam
- No exponential backoff for failed peers
- No circuit breaker to stop futile retries
- Health monitoring underutilized in connection decisions

**The Solution Planted:**

Three new intelligence layers woven into the P2P fabric:

1. **connectionBackoff.ts** — Exponential backoff + circuit breaker
   - Base delay: 2s, max: 5min
   - Circuit opens after 5 failures
   - Prevents resource waste on dead peers

2. **pendingConnectionCleanup.ts** — Watchdog for stuck connections
   - 30s timeout enforcement
   - Automatic cleanup every 10s
   - Eliminates "already pending" spam

3. **connectionQuality.ts** — Intelligent peer scoring
   - Tracks success rate, reliability, latency
   - Weighted composite scoring (60/25/15)
   - Top 100 peers persisted for smart auto-connect

**Integration Complete:**
- PeerJS adapter now respects backoff before connecting
- Records success/failure to all trackers
- Pending monitor lifecycle tied to adapter lifecycle
- Manager imports ready for quality-aware auto-connect

**Peer IDs remain constant. Active connections undisturbed. Only the intelligence layer evolved.**
