# ðŸ“± Mobile App Setup - Quick Start

Your Swarm Space app is now configured for mobile deployment with enhanced P2P background persistence!

## âœ… What's Been Set Up

- **Capacitor** installed and configured
- **Mobile background hooks** for keeping P2P alive
- **Network monitoring** for auto-reconnection
- **App lifecycle management** for iOS and Android

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### To Test on Your Device/Emulator:

1. **Export to GitHub**
   - Click the GitHub button in top right of Lovable
   - Export your project to your GitHub account

2. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd swarm-space
   npm install
   npx cap init  # Uses existing capacitor.config.ts
   ```

3. **Build and Add Platform**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   
   # For iOS (macOS only):
   npx cap add ios
   npx cap update ios
   npx cap run ios
   
   # For Android:
   npx cap add android
   npx cap update android
   npx cap run android
   ```

## ðŸ“š Full Documentation

See these files for detailed setup instructions:

- **[docs/MOBILE_SETUP.md](docs/MOBILE_SETUP.md)** - Complete mobile build guide
- **[docs/P2P_PROTOCOL.md](docs/P2P_PROTOCOL.md)** - Protocol spec for Electron app development

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Get

### Mobile App Features:
- âœ… Installable native app (iOS & Android)
- âœ… P2P connections stay alive in background
- âœ… Auto-reconnect on network changes
- âœ… Battery-optimized background sync
- âœ… Full access to device features

### Current Web App:
- Works immediately in browser
- No build required
- Hot-reload enabled during development

## ðŸ”® Future: Electron Desktop App

For an always-online desktop node, you'll need to build an Electron app separately using the P2P protocol documentation. The mobile app provides better background persistence than browsers but still has limitations compared to a true always-on daemon.
