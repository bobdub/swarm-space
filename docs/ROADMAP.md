## Success Metrics
- **Phase 1:** Users can create encrypted posts with files and view them locally
- **Phase 2:** Users can manage projects with working planner and tasks
- **Phase 3:** Users can interact socially and discover content
- **Phase 4:** Users can collaborate securely in private projects
- **Phase 5:** Users can share content P2P without central servers
- **Phase 6:** Platform scales to 1000+ users with good performance

---

## Technical Debt & Considerations
- **Browser compatibility:** Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Storage limits:** IndexedDB quotas vary by browser (plan for quota management)
- **Key recovery:** Emphasize backup UI/UX to prevent data loss
- **Conflict resolution:** Implement proper CRDT or operational transform for collaborative editing
- **Security audits:** Review crypto implementation before public release
