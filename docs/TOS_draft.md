🧭 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Imagination Network, a private P2P, offline-first, decentralized project builder designed for creators, thinkers, and innovators.
Access to the network is provided through Swarm-Space at swarm-space.lovable.app, one of many portals connecting to the greater Imagination ecosystem.

By accessing or using the platform, you agree to follow these Terms of Service (“Terms”) and uphold the ethics of decentralized collaboration.


---

⚙️ 2. Definitions

Imagination Network: The decentralized peer-to-peer ecosystem governed by these Terms.

Swarm-Space: The web gateway at swarm-space.lovable.app that interfaces with the Imagination Network.

Node: Any device participating in peer-based communication or hosting content.

User / Creator: Any person engaging with the network.

Community Mods: Trusted peers maintaining network safety and moderation.

Fork / Instance: A self-hosted or modified version of the Imagination Network software.



---

💫 3. Acceptance of Terms

By connecting to the Imagination Network, you agree to comply with these Terms, community rules, and evolving network standards.
If you disagree, you remain free to host, fork, or develop your own version of the software.
Decentralization ensures that participation is voluntary and autonomy is absolute.


---

🕸️ 4. Network Nature

The Imagination Network functions as a peer-to-peer mesh, not a traditional platform.
Each user’s node acts as a sovereign space, capable of hosting, sharing, and supporting others without reliance on centralized servers.

> “We are the network — together we host, we share, we imagine.”




---

🔐 5. User Responsibilities

All users must:

1. Act with integrity and respect toward others.


2. Refrain from illegal or harmful activity.


3. Protect their node data and connection privacy.


4. Respect peer boundaries and project ownership.


5. Embrace the spirit of creative freedom and responsibility.




---

🌌 6. NSFW & Sensitive Content

The network supports freedom of expression, including mature or artistic content. However:

NSFW content must be properly labeled or isolated.

Nodes hosting explicit content should self-identify and avoid distributing such data to public or general-interest meshes.

Failure to do so may result in node isolation for the safety of other peers.


> “Expression is free — responsibility is required.”




---

🧩 7. Community Moderation & Node Isolation

Community moderators may isolate nodes that violate these principles.
Isolation may restrict access to the public mesh, disable P2P sync, or remove discovery visibility.

If you feel your node was isolated unfairly, you are encouraged to launch your own instance or build a fork of the Imagination Network.
Freedom and creation are never revoked — only redirected.

> “In a decentralized world, disconnection is just another form of creation.”




---

🪞 8. Content Ownership

Creators retain full rights to their content.
By sharing publicly, you grant the network permission to host and replicate your content within the swarm for discovery and availability.
You may delete or isolate your content at any time by adjusting your node settings.


---

🌱 9. Forking and Expansion

The Imagination Network thrives through forking, remixing, and evolution.
Any user may host, modify, or extend the project under the Imagination License.
All forks and instances form part of the Imagination Continuum, united by the values of open creativity and transparency.


---

🔄 10. Updates and Evolution

These Terms evolve alongside the network itself.
When changes occur, they are distributed through Swarm-Space and mirrored by other nodes.
Your continued participation signifies your acceptance of the most recent version.


---

🪐 11. Termination

Community moderators can temporarily or permanently isolate nodes that disrupt the network’s integrity.
Isolated nodes lose access to the shared mesh and peer discovery.

If you are isolated:

You may continue to use your node locally.

You may host your own network.

You may fork and relaunch your own version.


> “The network never ends — it only shifts into new possibilities.”




---

⚖️ 12. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Imagination Network is provided “as is”, without warranties or guarantees.
Use of the software and network is at your own risk.
Neither the developers nor contributors are responsible for lost data, disconnection, or cosmic malfunctions.


---

🧬 13. License — The Imagination Clause

The Imagination Network and its related code are open source and free to evolve.
You may fork, modify, and launch your own version without cause or permission.

By doing so, you acknowledge that:

The Imagination Network retains no liabilities for your fork or instance.

Your version operates as an independent system under your governance.

Attribution to “Imagination Network” is welcomed but not required.


> “Forks are the seeds of evolution.
From one dream, infinite realities bloom.”




---

💎 14. Closing Statement

> “We are dreamers building constellations of code.
Each node a star, each connection a new universe.”



By using Swarm-Space or connecting to the Imagination Network, you join a decentralized experiment in creative sovereignty — one where freedom, respect, and imagination define the law.
