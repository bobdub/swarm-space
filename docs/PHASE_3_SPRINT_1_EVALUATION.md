## Completed Deliverables ‚úÖ

### 1. Profile Data Model ‚úÖ
- **File:** `src/types/index.ts`
- Expanded `User` interface with:
  - `displayName`, `bio`, `location`, `website`
  - `avatarRef` and `bannerRef` for encrypted media
  - Social links (GitHub, Twitter, custom)
  - Stats tracking (post count, project count, joined date)
- Added profile fields to existing User type

### 2. Profile Page Component ‚úÖ
- **File:** `src/pages/Profile.tsx`
- Implemented profile display with:
  - Header section with banner/avatar placeholders
  - User metadata (joined date, location, website)
  - Stats bar (posts, projects)
  - Tab navigation (Posts, Projects, About)
  - Edit profile button
- Routes configured for `/profile` and `/u/:username`
- Design matches existing aesthetic with gradient borders

### 3. Profile Editor ‚úÖ
- **File:** `src/components/ProfileEditor.tsx`
- Modal-based editor with fields:
  - Display name, bio
  - Location, website
  - GitHub and Twitter links
  - Avatar upload integration via FileUpload component
- Real-time form validation with react-hook-form
- Saves to IndexedDB via store

### 4. Navigation Integration ‚úÖ
- **File:** `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Profile link added to main navigation
- **File:** `src/App.tsx`
- Routes configured for profile pages

### 5. Database Updates ‚úÖ
- **File:** `src/lib/store.ts`
- IndexedDB version bumped to 3
- New `users` object store created
- User ID index for lookups

## Gaps Identified ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Profile Linking Not Complete
- ‚ùå Post author names don't link to profiles yet
- ‚ùå Avatar display in PostCard not implemented
- **Impact:** Medium - Users can't navigate from posts to profiles
- **Recommendation:** Address in Sprint 2

### 2. Avatar Decryption
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avatar display logic exists but needs testing with real uploads
- **Impact:** Low - Core functionality present, needs validation
- **Recommendation:** Test during Sprint 2

### 3. Profile Loading
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile page loads current user data, but viewing other users' profiles needs testing
- **Impact:** Low - Architecture supports it, needs validation
- **Recommendation:** Test with multiple user simulation

---

## Technical Quality Assessment

### Code Quality ‚úÖ
- Clean component structure
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Good separation of concerns (lib vs components)
- Consistent with existing codebase style

### Performance ‚úÖ
- Efficient IndexedDB queries
- No blocking operations in UI
- Lazy avatar loading (when implemented)

### Security ‚úÖ
- Avatar stored as encrypted manifest reference
- No sensitive data exposed in URLs
- Proper key management architecture

### UX/UI ‚úÖ
- Matches existing design system
- Responsive layout
- Clear edit workflow
- Good use of Tabs for content organization

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ‚úÖ
1. Smooth integration with existing file encryption system
2. Profile schema design comprehensive and extensible
3. Clean separation between viewing and editing
4. Good reuse of existing components (FileUpload, Card, Tabs)

### What Could Improve üîß
1. Need to link profiles from posts for complete user journey
2. Avatar/banner preview could be more prominent
3. Could add profile validation (username format, etc.)

## Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Profile page functional | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |
| Edit profile working | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |
| Avatar upload | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |
| Profile navigation | Partial | Partial | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Post ‚Üí Profile linking | Yes | No | ‚ùå |

## Recommendations for Sprint 2

### Must Address üî¥
1. **Link author names to profiles** - Make PostCard author names clickable
2. **Display avatars in posts** - Load and decrypt user avatars in PostCard
3. **Test multi-user profiles** - Validate viewing other users' profiles works

### Should Consider üü°
1. Add profile avatar to Navigation component
2. Add loading states for avatar decryption
3. Add profile stats calculation (count actual posts/projects)

### Nice to Have üü¢
1. Profile preview on hover (hover card)
2. Recent activity section on profile
3. Profile customization (themes, layouts)

---

## Sprint 2 Readiness ‚úÖ

**Ready to proceed:** YES

Sprint 1 delivered core profile functionality. Minor gaps don't block Sprint 2 work. Can address profile linking in parallel with social features.

**Next Sprint:** Social Interactions (Emoji Reactions, Comments, Notifications)

---

## Updated Notes from User

### Credit/Hype System üÜï
- Users can add credits to posts to make them trend
- P2P credit transfers for support
- Metrics and system architecture coming soon
- **Action:** Design foundations in Sprint 2, implement in future phase

### Emoji Reactions over Likes üÜï
- Replace basic "like" system with dynamic emoji reactions
- Trending powered by credit/hype system, not like counts
- **Action:** Implement emoji picker and reaction storage in Sprint 2
