Private Key Abstract

Purpose

The Private Key System provides users with a secure and decentralized method to transfer devices, restore data, and recover accounts supported by swarm nodes.
It ensures continuity of identity and data ownership without reliance on central authority or online validation.

Overview

The current offline-first P2P networking project builder already includes:

Public Keys for network authentication and identity.

Data Chunking for distributed storage and transmission.

P2P Connections for decentralized social and data interactions.


The Private Key extends this framework by functioning as the user’s cryptographic signature of ownership. It is the single access point that links all user-associated data and device sessions across the swarm.

Core Logic

1. Multi-Device Synchronization

Users authenticate across devices via their private key.

The source device encrypts user session data and sends it to the target device.

The target device decrypts and confirms identity through a handshake protocol using the shared private-public key pair.

Once verified, both devices are authorized to operate within the same swarm identity, maintaining decentralized coherence.


2. Account Recovery

If a user loses access to their primary device, the private key allows re-authentication and decryption of node-supported data.

Recovery occurs through swarm discovery: nodes storing fragments of user data respond to the verified key.

Upon decryption, the user’s account state, metadata, and personal data are reassembled via swarm consensus.

Security Model

The private key is never stored or transmitted in plaintext; it exists solely on the user’s device.

Responsibility Principle: The user is solely accountable for the security of their private key.

No node, swarm, or developer can recover a lost private key—this ensures absolute ownership and non-custodial control.

Cryptographic protocols prevent replay or impersonation attacks by rotating temporary session keys for every connection.

Technical Specification

1. Key Generation

Algorithm: Ed25519 or Secp256k1 (configurable based on platform).

Entropy Source: Local device randomness + optional user entropy (e.g., password-derived seed).

Output:

Public Key → Shared across swarm for discovery and connection.

Private Key → Stored locally, used for data encryption/decryption and authentication.



2. Encryption Schema

Symmetric Encryption: AES-256-GCM for chunk encryption during data transfer.

Asymmetric Encryption: Public/Private keypair used for handshake validation and shared secret generation.

Hashing: SHA3-512 for identity fingerprints and swarm record verification.


3. Swarm Handshake Protocol

1. Device A (authenticated) initiates connection with Device B using public key challenge.


2. Device B responds with its own signature proof.


3. Both devices compute a shared session secret using ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman).


4. The session is confirmed and encrypted using the temporary symmetric key.


5. Once established, both devices maintain a mirrored state of the user identity across the swarm.



4. Recovery Protocol

Upon re-entry, a node queries the swarm with the user’s public identity hash.

Nodes respond with data fragments encrypted to that identity.

The private key decrypts and reassembles the account state, restoring the user environment seamlessly.

Summary

This private key framework establishes trustless recoverability and device portability within the swarm-based social network.
By merging cryptographic identity with distributed node consensus, the system ensures:

True user ownership of identity and data.

Secure multi-device continuity.

Decentralized recovery independent of any central server.


The result is a self-sovereign identity layer compatible with any P2P node or swarm cluster within the network—empowering users to own their presence, data, and continuity across all devices.
