## 1. Introduction
The Imagination Network is a private, peer-to-peer, offline-first collaboration mesh designed for creators, researchers, and builders. Access to the network is provided through Swarm-Space at swarm-space.lovable.app and through community-operated gateways. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your participation. By using any portal or node that connects to the network you accept these Terms and agree to uphold the ethics of decentralized collaboration.

---

## 2. Key Definitions
- **Imagination Network**: The distributed peer-to-peer ecosystem governed by these Terms.
- **Swarm-Space**: The web gateway at swarm-space.lovable.app that interfaces with the Imagination Network.
- **Node**: Any device or service participating in peer-based communication or hosting content.
- **User / Creator**: Any person engaging with the network, whether hosting a node or connecting through a gateway.
- **Community Moderator**: A trusted peer coordinating safety responses and policy enforcement for a given mesh.
- **Fork / Instance**: A self-hosted or modified version of the Imagination Network software.

## 3. Eligibility and Accounts
Participation is open to individuals who can legally enter into binding agreements within their jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and distributed storage complies with applicable laws. Gateways may require account creation or authentication; any credentials issued are personal to you and must not be shared. You remain responsible for the security of your node, keys, and access tokens.

---

## 4. Acceptance of Terms
By connecting to or interacting with the Imagination Network you agree to these Terms, the community guidelines referenced herein, and any supplemental rules published for a specific mesh. If you disagree with any provision you may discontinue use, host your own fork, or participate under a different instance governed by alternate terms.

---

## 5. Nature of the Network
The Imagination Network functions as a peer-to-peer mesh, not a traditional centralized platform. Each participant’s node acts as a sovereign space capable of hosting, sharing, and supporting others without reliance on a single service provider.

> “We are the network — together we host, we share, we imagine.”

Because of this architecture:
- Availability may fluctuate as peers join or leave.
- Data replicated across nodes may persist beyond your direct control until peers synchronize updates.
- Community-driven moderation may vary between meshes.

---

## 6. Privacy and Data Stewardship
The network is designed to minimize central data collection; however, content you publish may be cached by peers or recorded in audit trails maintained by moderators. You should:
- Store only the information you are comfortable sharing with trusted peers.
- Label sensitive data and limit replication according to the privacy features available on your node.
- Respect the privacy decisions of others and honor revocation or deletion requests whenever technically possible.

Gateway operators may log limited diagnostic data (such as connection metadata) to maintain reliability and security. Review their supplemental privacy statements where provided.

---

## 7. User Responsibilities
All users must:
1. Act with integrity, care, and respect toward others.
2. Refrain from illegal, abusive, or exploitative activity.
3. Protect their node data, cryptographic keys, and connection privacy.
4. Honor project ownership, consent boundaries, and licensing terms.
5. Report suspected security issues responsibly.
6. Embrace the spirit of creative freedom while accepting the obligations that accompany shared stewardship.

---

## 8. Community Standards and Prohibited Conduct
The network operates on mutual trust. Prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to:
- Harassment, discrimination, or targeted abuse.
- Disseminating malware, spyware, or other malicious code.
- Attempting to deanonymize participants without explicit consent.
- Spamming, resource exhaustion attacks, or mesh disruption.
- Misrepresenting affiliation or impersonating other creators.

Violations may trigger community enforcement actions and may be reported to relevant authorities if legally required.

---

## 9. Sensitive and NSFW Content
Freedom of expression includes the right to share mature or artistic content. Responsible handling requires that you:
- Clearly label NSFW or sensitive material and segregate it when feasible.
- Configure your node to avoid distributing explicit content to general-interest meshes.
- Respect peers who opt out of receiving such material.

Failure to comply may result in node isolation to protect other participants.

> “Expression is free — responsibility is required.”

---

## 10. Moderation, Remedies, and Node Isolation
Community moderators may isolate or throttle nodes that violate these Terms or local community policies. Isolation may restrict access to shared meshes, disable synchronization, or remove discovery visibility. When possible, moderators will provide notice describing the cause and steps for reinstatement. You may always continue using your node locally, host your own mesh, or fork the project.

> “In a decentralized world, disconnection is just another form of creation.”

---

## 11. Intellectual Property and Licensing
Creators retain all rights to their original content. By sharing publicly you grant the network a non-exclusive, worldwide license to transmit, cache, and reproduce your content within the swarm for availability and discovery. You may revoke that license by deleting or isolating your content, though previously replicated copies may persist until peers sync. Software components are released under the Imagination License unless otherwise noted.

---

## 12. Forking and Open Development
The Imagination Network thrives through forking, remixing, and experimentation. Any user may host, modify, or extend the project in accordance with the Imagination License. Forks should clearly disclose deviations from these Terms and must not misrepresent affiliation with the primary mesh.

---

## 13. Security, Availability, and Risk
You acknowledge that:
- Peer-to-peer systems carry inherent security and uptime risks.
- Data transmitted across the mesh may be intercepted by malicious actors if you do not use end-to-end encryption.
- Backups and redundancy are your responsibility.

The project is provided “as is.” No warranty is expressed or implied regarding availability, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

---

## 14. Third-Party Integrations
Nodes or gateways may interface with third-party tools, wallets, or services. Those services are governed by their own terms, and the Imagination Network bears no responsibility for their policies or availability. Review third-party agreements before enabling integrations.

---

## 15. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Imagination Network, its contributors, and moderators are not liable for:
- Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.
- Loss of data, profits, goodwill, or other intangible losses.
- Unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or content.

Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction is to discontinue participation or operate an independent fork.

---

## 16. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Imagination Network contributors, moderators, and gateway operators from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of your use of the network or violation of these Terms.

---

## 17. Changes to These Terms
These Terms evolve alongside the network. Material updates will be distributed through Swarm-Space and mirrored by cooperating nodes. Continued participation after notice of changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you object to any update you may cease participation or operate under an alternative fork.

---

## 18. Contact and Feedback
Questions, feedback, or moderation appeals may be directed to the maintainers via the communication channels listed in the repository README or by submitting an issue or pull request. Gateway operators may provide additional contact methods.

---

By accessing the Imagination Network you affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Service.
