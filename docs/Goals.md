## 🌟 Primary Goals

### 1. **User Data Sovereignty**
- Users own their encryption keys
- All data stored locally by default
- No central authority can access user content
- Export/backup functionality always available
- Future: Optional encrypted cloud backup with user-held keys

### 2. **Offline-First Operation**
- Full functionality without internet connection
- Local encryption and storage
- Queue changes for sync when connection available
- Resilient to network failures
- Fast, responsive UX (no server round trips)

### 3. **Privacy by Design**
- End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- Zero-knowledge architecture (no server can decrypt)
- Minimal metadata exposure
- User control over what's shared and with whom
- Clear security indicators in UI

### 4. **Decentralization Ready**
- Prepared for P2P networking (WebRTC)
- Content-addressed storage (chunks identified by hash)
- Signed metadata for trust verification
- No single point of failure
- User devices become network nodes

### 5. **Real-World Usability**
- Intuitive UI for non-technical users
- Familiar social media patterns
- Project management tools comparable to centralized platforms
- Clear onboarding and recovery flows
- Accessibility as a first-class concern

## 🔐 Security Goals

### Confidentiality
- ✅ Local identity keys (ECDH for key exchange, Ed25519 for signatures)
- ✅ File-level encryption (AES-GCM with unique IVs per chunk)
- ✅ Passphrase-based key wrapping (PBKDF2 with 200k iterations)
- 🔄 Group encryption (project keys encrypted per member)
- 📋 Perfect forward secrecy (future: rotate keys on member removal)

### Integrity
- ✅ Content-addressed chunks (SHA-256 hash verification)
- 🔄 Signed metadata (Ed25519 signatures on posts/manifests)
- 📋 Merkle trees for large file verification (future)
- 📋 Audit logs for security events

### Availability
- ✅ Offline-first storage (IndexedDB)
- 🔄 Change queue for sync (conflict detection)
- 📋 P2P content distribution (no central server dependency)
- ⚠️ Multi-device sync (encrypted sync between user's devices)

### Recovery
- ✅ Account backup/export (encrypted bundle)
- ✅ Clear warning about key loss
- 📋 Optional server-side encrypted backup (user chooses)
- 📋 Social recovery (future: key shards with trusted contacts)

## 🚀 Feature Goals

### Phase 1: Core Content (Shipped foundation, polish in progress)
- [x] Local account creation with encryption
- [x] File upload with chunking and encryption
- [x] File management and preview
- [x] Post creation with file attachments
- [x] Feed with real posts from IndexedDB
- [x] Project creation and management
- [ ] Post preview before publishing
- [ ] Feed filtering, infinite scroll, and local trending

**Remaining gaps:** improve feed ergonomics (preview + filters) and wire project-specific storage for shared assets.

### Phase 2: Planning Tools (Complete)
- [x] Task manager with kanban board
- [x] Drag-and-drop task organization
- [x] Calendar with milestones
- [x] Task-milestone linking
- [ ] Offline sync queue foundation (deferred to Phase 5)

**Remaining gaps:** ship the deferred sync queue once P2P conflict resolution is available.

### Phase 3: Social Features (In progress)
- [x] User profiles and bios
- [x] Post comments and threading
- [x] Like/reaction system with custom emoji picker
- [x] Notifications for interactions
- [x] Credit and hype economy (send + boost posts)
- [ ] Follow/follower system and social graph surfacing
- [ ] Advanced reactions (analytics, moderation tooling, multi-device sync)
- [ ] Activity + discovery upgrades on Explore (people directory, trending collections)

**Remaining gaps:** deepen social connections (follows, discovery) and ensure reactions/credits stay consistent across peers and devices.

### Phase 4: Collaboration (Future)
- [ ] Group encryption for projects
- [ ] Member invitation flow
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Project chat/discussions
- [ ] Collaborative document editing

### Phase 5: P2P Networking (Future)
- [ ] WebRTC signaling and NAT traversal
- [ ] Peer discovery and connection management
- [ ] Content distribution via peer swarms
- [ ] Manifest gossiping protocol
- [ ] Bandwidth management and optimization

### Phase 6: Scale & Polish (Future)
- [ ] Web Workers for crypto operations
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] IndexedDB quota monitoring
- [ ] Desktop app (Electron/Tauri)
- [ ] Mobile PWA optimization

## 📊 Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Onboarding:** < 2 minutes to create account and first post
- **Performance:** < 100ms UI response for local operations
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for offline operations
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Security
- **Encryption:** 100% of sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Key Security:** Zero plaintext key storage
- **Audit:** Pass third-party security review (Phase 5+)
- **Recovery:** Clear backup UI shown to 100% of new users

### Adoption (Long-term)
- **Users:** 10k+ active users by end of Phase 5
- **Content:** 1M+ encrypted chunks stored across network
- **Retention:** 60%+ monthly active user retention
- **Projects:** 1k+ collaborative projects created

## 🧭 Design Principles

### 1. **Local-First, Global Optional**
Default to local storage and encryption. Network features are enhancements, not requirements.

### 2. **Explicit Over Implicit**
Never hide important decisions. Users should understand:
- What's encrypted vs. public
- What happens to their keys
- Recovery limitations
- Sync status

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
Core features work offline, enhanced features work online. Degrade gracefully.

### 4. **No Surprises**
- No hidden costs (storage quotas visible)
- No unexpected data loss (backup reminders)
- No silent failures (clear error messages)

### 5. **Accessible by Default**
- Keyboard navigation everywhere
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast compliance
- Clear focus indicators

- Rich media previews
- Smooth infinite scroll (planned)
- Engaging interactions (likes, comments)
- Reaction insights & moderation tooling (planned)

### Project Feel
- Clear project hierarchy
- Visual progress indicators
- Intuitive task management
- Calendar integration

### Trust Indicators

- Public roadmap and issue tracker
- Community contributions welcome
- Transparent development process

### Documentation
- Comprehensive user guides
- Developer API docs
- Security whitepaper
- Architecture deep-dives

### Education

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision

### 5-Year Goal
**A thriving ecosystem of decentralized collaboration tools** where:
- Users control their data completely
- No single entity can shut down the network
- Privacy and security are defaults, not features
- Collaboration happens peer-to-peer
- Platform is accessible to everyone

### Inspiration
- **Technical:** IPFS, Secure Scuttlebutt, Matrix, BitTorrent
- **Social:** Mastodon, Discord, Notion, Linear
- **Philosophical:** IndieWeb, Right to Repair, Digital Commons

### Non-Goals (What We Won't Do)
- ❌ Blockchain or cryptocurrency integration
- ❌ Monetization through ads or data harvesting
- ❌ Centralized control or governance
- ❌ Lock-in or proprietary formats
- ❌ Compromise on encryption for "convenience"
