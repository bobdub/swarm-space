# Imagination Network - Project Goals & Vision

## 🎯 Core Mission
Build a **decentralized, offline-first social and project collaboration platform** that empowers users with data ownership, privacy, and freedom from centralized control.

---

## 🌟 Primary Goals

### 1. **User Data Sovereignty**
- Users own their encryption keys
- All data stored locally by default
- No central authority can access user content
- Export/backup functionality always available
- Future: Optional encrypted cloud backup with user-held keys

### 2. **Offline-First Operation**
- Full functionality without internet connection
- Local encryption and storage
- Queue changes for sync when connection available
- Resilient to network failures
- Fast, responsive UX (no server round trips)

### 3. **Privacy by Design**
- End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- Zero-knowledge architecture (no server can decrypt)
- Minimal metadata exposure
- User control over what's shared and with whom
- Clear security indicators in UI

### 4. **Decentralization Ready**
- Prepared for P2P networking (WebRTC)
- Content-addressed storage (chunks identified by hash)
- Signed metadata for trust verification
- No single point of failure
- User devices become network nodes

### 5. **Real-World Usability**
- Intuitive UI for non-technical users
- Familiar social media patterns
- Project management tools comparable to centralized platforms
- Clear onboarding and recovery flows
- Accessibility as a first-class concern

## 🔐 Security Goals

### Confidentiality
- ✅ Local identity keys (ECDH for key exchange, Ed25519 for signatures)
- ✅ File-level encryption (AES-GCM with unique IVs per chunk)
- ✅ Passphrase-based key wrapping (PBKDF2 with 200k iterations)
- 🔄 Group encryption (project keys encrypted per member)
- 📋 Perfect forward secrecy (future: rotate keys on member removal)

### Integrity
- ✅ Content-addressed chunks (SHA-256 hash verification)
- 🔄 Signed metadata (Ed25519 signatures on posts/manifests)
- 📋 Merkle trees for large file verification (future)
- 📋 Audit logs for security events

### Availability
- ✅ Offline-first storage (IndexedDB)
- 🔄 Change queue for sync (conflict detection)
- 📋 P2P content distribution (no central server dependency)
- 📋 Multi-device sync (encrypted sync between user's devices)

### Recovery
- ✅ Account backup/export (encrypted bundle)
- ✅ Clear warning about key loss
- 📋 Optional server-side encrypted backup (user chooses)
- 📋 Social recovery (future: key shards with trusted contacts)

## 🧭 Design Principles

### 1. **Local-First, Global Optional**
Default to local storage and encryption. Network features are enhancements, not requirements.

### 2. **Explicit Over Implicit**
Never hide important decisions. Users should understand:
- What's encrypted vs. public
- What happens to their keys
- Recovery limitations
- Sync status

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
Core features work offline, enhanced features work online. Degrade gracefully.

### 4. **No Surprises**
- No hidden costs (storage quotas visible)
- No unexpected data loss (backup reminders)
- No silent failures (clear error messages)

### 5. **Accessible by Default**
- Keyboard navigation everywhere
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast compliance
- Clear focus indicators

## 🎨 UX Goals

### Social Feel
- Familiar feed layout (like Twitter/Mastodon)
- Rich media previews
- Smooth infinite scroll
- Engaging interactions (likes, comments)

### Project Feel
- Clear project hierarchy
- Visual progress indicators
- Intuitive task management
- Calendar integration

### Trust Indicators
- Encryption status badges
- Sync status visible

## 🤝 Community Goals

### Open Source
- MIT license for core platform
- Public roadmap and issue tracker
- Community contributions welcome
- Transparent development process

### Documentation
- Comprehensive user guides
- Developer API docs
- Security whitepaper
- Architecture deep-dives

### Education
- Explain cryptography concepts simply
- Blog posts about privacy and decentralization

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision

### 5-Year Goal
**A thriving ecosystem of decentralized collaboration tools** where:
- Users control their data completely
- No single entity can shut down the network
- Privacy and security are defaults, not features
- Collaboration happens peer-to-peer
- Platform is accessible to everyone

### Inspiration
- **Technical:** IPFS, Secure Scuttlebutt, Matrix, BitTorrent
- **Social:** Mastodon, Discord, Notion, Linear
- **Philosophical:** IndieWeb, Right to Repair, Digital Commons

### Non-Goals (What We Won't Do)
- ❌ Blockchain or cryptocurrency integration
- ❌ Monetization through ads or data harvesting
- ❌ Centralized control or governance
- ❌ Lock-in or proprietary formats
- ❌ Compromise on encryption for "convenience"
