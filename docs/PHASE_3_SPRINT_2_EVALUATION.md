## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Notifications System (100%)

#### Data Layer
- ‚úÖ `Notification` interface in types
- ‚úÖ Notification storage in IndexedDB (DB_VERSION 4)
- ‚úÖ `src/lib/notifications.ts` with full CRUD operations:
  - `createNotification()` - Generate notifications
  - `getNotifications()` - Fetch user notifications
  - `getUnreadCount()` - Count unread notifications
  - `markAsRead()` - Mark single notification as read
  - `markAllAsRead()` - Bulk mark as read

#### Integration
- ‚úÖ Notifications generated on reactions (`addReaction` in interactions.ts)
- ‚úÖ Notifications generated on comments (`addComment` in interactions.ts)
- ‚úÖ Proper filtering (users don't get notified of their own actions)

#### UI Components
- ‚úÖ Full-featured `Notifications` page:
  - Real-time loading of notifications
  - Grouped display by type (reaction, comment, follow, mention)
  - Visual indicators for unread notifications
  - Individual "mark as read" actions
  - Bulk "mark all as read" button
  - Links to related posts
  - User-friendly empty states
  - Loading states with animations
  
- ‚úÖ `NotificationBadge` component:
  - Displays unread count on navigation bell icon
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
  - Hides when count is zero
  - Beautiful gradient styling matching design system

### 2. Avatar System (100%)

#### Core Component
- ‚úÖ `src/components/Avatar.tsx`:
  - Loads encrypted avatar images from manifests
  - Four size variants: sm, md, lg, xl
  - Fallback to user initials when no avatar
  - Proper image cleanup (URL.revokeObjectURL)
  - Responsive and accessible

#### Integration
- ‚úÖ **Navigation** - User profile area shows avatar
- ‚úÖ **PostCard** - Author avatar in post header
- ‚úÖ **CommentThread** - Commenter avatars
- ‚úÖ **Notifications** - Trigger user avatars

#### Technical Implementation
- ‚úÖ Decrypts avatars using `decryptAndReassembleFile`
- ‚úÖ Handles missing avatars gracefully
- ‚úÖ Uses design system tokens (HSL colors)
- ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript typing
