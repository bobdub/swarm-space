# 🧭 Node Dashboard & Stability Improvements — Project Plan

This initiative focuses on enhancing peer-to-peer (P2P) networking visibility, control, and resilience through a multi-phase rollout. The goal is to empower users with robust tools for managing their nodes and connections while improving overall network stability.

---

## 📍 Phase 0: Node Dashboard Implementation

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive Node Dashboard accessible from the P2P networking tab.

**Tasks:**
- Add “View Node Dashboard” button to the P2P networking tab.
- Design the Node Dashboard UI to include:
  - **Signaling Endpoint**: Display current signaling server details.
  - **Rendezvous Mesh**: Show mesh topology and peer discovery status.
  - **Mesh Controls**: Enable/disable mesh routing, refresh peers.
  - **User Node Controls**:
    - Block node/user
    - Pause incoming/outgoing connections
  - **Networking Stats**: Bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss.
  - **Connection Lists**: Active peers, connection strength, last handshake.
  - **Enable/Disable P2P Network**: Toggle full P2P functionality.
  - *(Optional)* Add diagnostics, logs, and node health indicators.

**P2P Networking Tab Updates:**
- Retain:
  - Enable/Disable toggle
  - Network Stats summary
  - Connection Strength indicator
  - View Node Dashboard button

## 🛡️ Phase 1: Robust User & Network Controls

**Objective:** Strengthen control mechanisms for users and network stability.

**Tasks:**
- Enhance blocking functionality:
  - Block by node ID or user ID
  - Persistent block list with UI management
- Add “Stop Signaling” feature:
  - Temporarily halt signaling to reduce noise or isolate issues
- Improve connection list stability:
  - Robust and true “Disconnect” option for individual peers
  - Ensure graceful teardown of connections to prevent memory leaks or dangling sockets
  - Monitor and auto-recover from unstable or dropped connections
- Prioritize control responsiveness and fail-safes:
  - Ensure controls work even under degraded network conditions
  - Add confirmation prompts and rollback options

## 🔗 Phase 2: Resilience Enhancements via WebTorrent & GUN.js

**Objective:** Evaluate and integrate decentralized technologies to improve connectivity and fault tolerance.

**Tasks:**
- Review `Resilience.md` for current architecture and failure modes.
- Create a technical proposal to integrate:
  - **WebTorrent**: For peer-to-peer file sharing and fallback transport.
  - **GUN.js**: For decentralized data sync and mesh resilience.
- Define integration boundaries:
  - These tools will **enhance**, not replace, existing systems.
- Draft implementation roadmap:
  - Compatibility layer
  - Data flow mapping
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Security considerations
