## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 6.1: Credits System Foundation (60% Complete)
See `docs/CREDITS_PHASE_6.1_STATUS.md` for detailed status.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Data models and IndexedDB schema
- ✅ Core credit earning/spending functions
- ✅ Hype system with burn mechanism
- ✅ P2P credit transfers
- ✅ Input validation and security
- ✅ Basic UI integration

**In Progress:**
- ⏳ Credit transaction history UI
- ⏳ Hosting reward triggers
- ⏳ Balance reactivity improvements
- ⏳ Credit limits and rate limiting

**Next Up:**
- 🎯 CreditHistory component
- 🎯 Navigation credit balance indicator
- 🎯 Comprehensive testing suite

### Phase 5.2: Beta Testing & Feedback (Parallel)
- ⏳ User testing of published app
- ⏳ Bug reports and fixes
- ⏳ Mobile UI refinements

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Credits System
1. **Transaction History Missing**: No UI to view past credit transactions
2. **Balance Not Reactive**: Profile doesn't auto-update after credit actions
3. **Hosting Credits Stub**: Function exists but not triggered by P2P events
4. **No Rate Limiting**: Users could spam transactions
5. **Genesis Loophole**: Could be re-awarded if balance record cleared

### General
1. **File Key Persistence**: File encryption keys need to be stored encrypted with user's master key
2. **No Storage Quota Monitoring**: Browser quota limits not tracked
3. **Single Device Only**: No sync between devices yet (Phase 5)
4. **No Recovery Without Backup**: Lost keys = lost account

## Immediate Next Steps

### Complete Phase 6.1: Credits Foundation
1. 🎯 **CreditHistory component** - Transaction viewer with filters
2. 🎯 **Navigation credit badge** - Show balance in nav bar
3. 🎯 **Hosting rewards trigger** - Hook into storage events
4. 🎯 **Balance reactivity** - Real-time updates after transactions
5. 🎯 **Rate limiting** - Prevent transaction spam
6. 🎯 **Comprehensive testing** - Edge cases and concurrency

### Start Phase 6.2: P2P Credit Flow
1. 🎯 Tipping system (separate from Hype)
2. 🎯 Credit gifting with messages
3. 🎯 Transaction notifications
4. 🎯 Credit leaderboards

### Continue Phase 5.2: Testing & Refinement
