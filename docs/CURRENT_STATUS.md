- ✅ AES-GCM encryption with unique IVs per chunk (64KB chunks)
- ✅ SHA-256 content addressing for chunks
- ✅ Manifest-based file management
- ✅ File upload component with drag-and-drop (`src/components/FileUpload.tsx`)
- ✅ Real-time encryption progress tracking
- ✅ File preview/download component (`src/components/FilePreview.tsx`)
- ✅ Files management page with search and filtering (`src/pages/Files.tsx`)

### UI Components
- ✅ Navigation sidebar with all main routes (including Files)
- ✅ Post card component with file attachment display
- ✅ Project card component (basic)

### Pages
- ✅ Home/Index page with landing + feed skeleton
- ✅ Settings page with account creation, security info, backup/recovery
- ✅ Explore page (placeholder)
- ✅ Notifications page (placeholder)
- ✅ Tasks page with sample kanban board
- ✅ Planner page (placeholder)
- ✅ Create post page with file attachment support
- ✅ Files page with search, filtering, and management

### Security & Encryption
- ✅ ECDH key pair generation (P-256 curve)
- ✅ Passphrase-based key wrapping (PBKDF2 + AES-GCM)
- ✅ User ID derived from public key (SHA-256)
- ✅ Account backup/restore (encrypted export/import)
- ✅ Local storage of user identity
- ✅ File-level encryption with unique keys
- ✅ Chunked storage for large files (64KB chunks)
- ✅ Content-addressed chunk storage

## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 2 Sprint 1: Task System (Current)
- ✅ Task CRUD operations with IndexedDB
- ✅ Drag-and-drop kanban board (@dnd-kit)
- ✅ Task creation/editing modal
- ✅ Task status updates via drag-and-drop
- ✅ Milestone CRUD operations
- ✅ Calendar component with milestones
- ✅ Milestone creation/editing modal
- ⏳ File attachment decryption in PostCard
- ⏳ Sync queue foundation

### Phase 1 Sprint 3: Project Management (Deferred)
- ⏳ Project creation flow
- ⏳ Project detail page with tabs
- ⏳ Project-scoped posts
- ⏳ Member management

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **File Key Persistence**: File encryption keys need to be stored encrypted with user's master key
2. **Feed Loading**: Need to implement post loading from IndexedDB on Index page
3. **No Storage Quota Monitoring**: Browser quota limits not tracked
4. **Single Device Only**: No sync between devices yet
5. **No Recovery Without Backup**: Lost keys = lost account

## Immediate Next Steps

### Sprint 2 Tasks (This Week)
1. ✅ File encryption module - DONE
2. ✅ File upload component - DONE
3. ✅ File management page - DONE
4. ✅ File preview/download - DONE
5. ⏳ Implement file key persistence
6. ⏳ Load posts from IndexedDB on feed
7. ⏳ Display file attachments in posts
8. ⏳ Add post filtering tabs
9. ⏳ Basic trending algorithm
