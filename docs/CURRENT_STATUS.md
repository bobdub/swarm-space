## üöß In Progress

### Phase 6.1: Credits System Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
See `docs/CREDITS_PHASE_6.1_STATUS.md` for detailed status.

**Completed (100%):**
- ‚úÖ Data models and IndexedDB schema
- ‚úÖ Core credit earning/spending functions
- ‚úÖ Hype system with burn mechanism (5 credits, 20% burn)
- ‚úÖ P2P credit transfers with validation

- ‚è≥ Mobile UI refinements

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Authentication & Sessions - ‚úÖ FIXED
- ‚úÖ Users now stay logged in after refresh
- ‚úÖ P2P preference persisted and auto-enables
- ‚úÖ Reactive auth state across all components

### Credits System (Minor Issues Only)
1. **Hosting Credits**: Function stub exists but not triggered (deferred to Phase 6.3)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Transaction spam prevention (deferred to Phase 6.2)
3. **Genesis Loophole**: Minor edge case if balance record cleared

### General
1. **File Key Persistence**: File encryption keys need to be stored encrypted with user's master key
2. **No Storage Quota Monitoring**: Browser quota limits not tracked
3. **Single Device Only**: No sync between devices yet (Phase 5)
4. **No Recovery Without Backup**: Lost keys = lost account

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Start Phase 6.2: P2P Credit Flow
1. üéØ **Tipping system** - Separate from Hype, custom amounts
2. üéØ **Credit gifting** - Send credits with messages
3. üéØ **Transaction notifications** - Alert users of received credits
4. üéØ **Credit leaderboards** - Top earners and contributors
5. üéØ **Rate limiting** - Prevent transaction spam
6. üéØ **Credit analytics** - Charts and insights

### Continue Phase 5.2: Testing & Refinement
1. üéØ Bug fixes from beta testing
2. üéØ Mobile UI polish
3. üéØ Performance optimizations
