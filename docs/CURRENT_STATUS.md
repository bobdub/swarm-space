## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 5: P2P with PeerJS ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-24)
**Goal:** Enable zero-config cross-device peer-to-peer networking

**Completed (100%):**
- ✅ PeerJS integration for zero-config signaling
- ✅ Cross-device WebRTC peer discovery
- ✅ Direct P2P data channels for content transfer
- ✅ Chunk distribution protocol
- ✅ Post synchronization across peers
- ✅ User connection management system
- ✅ Connection manager UI (browse & connect)
- ✅ One-click peer connections
- ✅ Persistent connections in IndexedDB (v6)
- ✅ Auto-sync with connected users
- ✅ Enhanced P2P status indicator
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

**External Dependency:**
- PeerJS Cloud for WebRTC signaling (zero config)
- See README.md for privacy implications
- Alternative: Self-hosted PeerJS server

**How It Works:**
1. Enable P2P in app (click Wi-Fi icon)
2. Click "Connections" to browse available users
3. One-click "Connect" to any user
4. PeerJS handles signaling automatically
5. Direct P2P connection established
6. Content syncs automatically

### Phase 6.1: Credits System Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
See `docs/CREDITS_PHASE_6.1_STATUS.md` for detailed status.

**Completed (100%):**
- ✅ Data models and IndexedDB schema
- ✅ Core credit earning/spending functions
- ✅ Hype system with burn mechanism (5 credits, 20% burn)
- ✅ P2P credit transfers with validation
- ✅ Input validation and security (Zod schemas)
- ✅ Full UI integration with account setup flow
- ✅ Mobile-responsive unified navigation
- ✅ CreditHistory component with transaction viewer
- ✅ Credit balance badge in TopNavigationBar
- ✅ useCreditBalance hook with auto-refresh
- ✅ Profile Credits tab with full history

### Phase 5.2: Social P2P Features (Next)
- ⏳ Connected user feed filtering
- ⏳ Connection requests & approvals
- ⏳ Block/unblock functionality
- ⏳ Connection recommendations
- ⏳ Enhanced P2P performance optimization

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Authentication & Sessions - ✅ FIXED
- ✅ Users now stay logged in after refresh
- ✅ P2P preference persisted and auto-enables
- ✅ Reactive auth state across all components

### Credits System (Minor Issues Only)
1. **Hosting Credits**: Award helper grants 1 credit per MB but no automated trigger yet (deferred to Phase 6.3)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Transaction spam prevention (deferred to Phase 6.2)
3. **Genesis Loophole**: Minor edge case if balance record cleared

### General
1. **File Key Persistence**: File encryption keys need to be stored encrypted with user's master key
2. **No Storage Quota Monitoring**: Browser quota limits not tracked
3. **Single Device Only**: No sync between devices yet (Phase 5)
4. **No Recovery Without Backup**: Lost keys = lost account

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Phase 5.2 - Social P2P Features
1. 🎯 **Feed filtering** - Show only connected users' posts
2. 🎯 **Connection approvals** - Request/accept connection flow
3. 🎯 **Block users** - Privacy and safety controls
4. 🎯 **Connection recommendations** - Suggest mutual connections
5. 🎯 **P2P performance** - Optimize chunk distribution
6. 🎯 **Self-hosted PeerJS docs** - Guide for private deployments

### Priority 2: Phase 6.2 - P2P Credit Flow
1. 🎯 **Tipping system** - Separate from Hype, custom amounts
2. 🎯 **Credit gifting** - Send credits with messages
3. 🎯 **Transaction notifications** - Alert users of received credits
4. 🎯 **Credit leaderboards** - Top earners and contributors
5. 🎯 **Rate limiting** - Prevent transaction spam
6. 🎯 **Credit analytics** - Charts and insights

### Simulation & Integration Coverage

| Scenario | Status | Coverage Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Conflicting credit transactions** | 🟡 Script design complete | Harness planned for simultaneous hype burns, P2P transfers, and signup rewards hitting the ledger; awaiting automation in swarm simulator. |
| **Ledger desynchronization & recovery** | 🟡 In progress | Recovery coordinator flow mapped from `ARCHITECTURE.md`; needs scripted fragment drop/resync sequence with quorum arbitration assertions. |
| **Handle claim conflict journeys** | 🔴 Not started | UI storyboard variants enumerated in `WIREFRAME_OVERVIEW.md`; requires backend-driven race to validate notifications and conflict resolution. |
| **Council adjudication replay protection** | 🔴 Not started | Gossip + signed payload replay matrix drafted; needs integration checks that rejected fragments stay quarantined across retries. |
| **Hosting credit accrual accuracy** | 🔴 Not started | Calculation stub tracked in Known Issues; simulation must cover varying uptime and bandwidth heuristics before enabling payouts. |

> ✅ = automated in CI, 🟡 = scripted/manual coverage underway, 🔴 = planned only
