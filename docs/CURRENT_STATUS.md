- ✅ Comment input and posting
- ✅ Link post author names to profiles
- ✅ Avatar initials link to profiles
- 🎯 Notifications system (STARTING NOW)
- 🎯 Avatar image display (needs component)
- 🎯 Notification badge on nav (after notifications)

### Phase 3 Sprint 1: User Profiles ✅ COMPLETE
- See docs/PHASE_3_SPRINT_1_EVALUATION.md for detailed evaluation

### Deferred to Later Phases
- ⏳ Project Management (Phase 4)
- ⏳ Sync queue foundation (Phase 5)

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **File Key Persistence**: File encryption keys need to be stored encrypted with user's master key
2. **Feed Loading**: Need to implement post loading from IndexedDB on Index page
3. **No Storage Quota Monitoring**: Browser quota limits not tracked
4. **Single Device Only**: No sync between devices yet
5. **No Recovery Without Backup**: Lost keys = lost account

## Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 3 Sprint 2 Completion (2-3 Days)
1. 🎯 Notification data model & generation
2. 🎯 Notifications page with grouped display
3. 🎯 Notification badge on navigation
4. 🎯 Avatar image decryption component
5. 🎯 Profile/post avatar integration
6. 🎯 UI polish and testing

### Optional Quick Fix
- ⏳ File attachment display in PostCard (can be done in parallel)

## Testing Status

### Tested ✅
- Account creation and login flow
- Account backup/restore
- File upload with encryption
- File management and deletion
