## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 5.3: Cross-Device P2P Signaling ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-24)
**Goal:** Enable peer discovery across devices/browsers via WebSocket relay

**Completed (100%):**
- ✅ WebSocket signaling relay edge function (`supabase/functions/p2p-signaling/`)
- ✅ No database dependency - pure message relay for WebRTC
- ✅ Auto-deployment with Lovable Cloud
- ✅ Dual-mode support (Local BroadcastChannel + Remote WebSocket)
- ✅ Enhanced UI with "Local Mode" vs "Remote Mode" indicators
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Setup documentation (`docs/P2P_SETUP.md`)
- ✅ `.env.example` with configuration guide

**How to Enable Remote P2P:**
1. Deploy app (signaling function auto-deploys)
2. Set `VITE_SIGNALING_URL=wss://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/p2p-signaling` in `.env`
3. Restart dev server
4. Open app on multiple devices with P2P enabled

### Phase 6.1: Credits System Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
See `docs/CREDITS_PHASE_6.1_STATUS.md` for detailed status.

**Completed (100%):**
- ✅ Data models and IndexedDB schema
- ✅ Core credit earning/spending functions
- ✅ Hype system with burn mechanism (5 credits, 20% burn)
- ✅ P2P credit transfers with validation
- ✅ Input validation and security (Zod schemas)
- ✅ Full UI integration with account setup flow
- ✅ Mobile-responsive unified navigation
- ✅ CreditHistory component with transaction viewer
- ✅ Credit balance badge in TopNavigationBar
- ✅ useCreditBalance hook with auto-refresh
- ✅ Profile Credits tab with full history

### Phase 5.4: P2P Testing & Stabilization (Current)
- ⏳ Test signaling server under load
- ⏳ Verify cross-device discovery reliability  
- ⏳ Monitor WebRTC connection stability
- ⏳ Test NAT traversal (may need TURN fallback)
- ⏳ Add connection quality metrics

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Authentication & Sessions - ✅ FIXED
- ✅ Users now stay logged in after refresh
- ✅ P2P preference persisted and auto-enables
- ✅ Reactive auth state across all components

### Credits System (Minor Issues Only)
1. **Hosting Credits**: Function stub exists but not triggered (deferred to Phase 6.3)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Transaction spam prevention (deferred to Phase 6.2)
3. **Genesis Loophole**: Minor edge case if balance record cleared

### General
1. **File Key Persistence**: File encryption keys need to be stored encrypted with user's master key
2. **No Storage Quota Monitoring**: Browser quota limits not tracked
3. **Single Device Only**: No sync between devices yet (Phase 5)
4. **No Recovery Without Backup**: Lost keys = lost account

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Phase 5.4 - P2P Testing & Stabilization
1. 🎯 **Deploy signaling server** - Set VITE_SIGNALING_URL and test deployment
2. 🎯 **Cross-device testing** - Test on multiple devices/browsers
3. 🎯 **Stress testing** - Multiple simultaneous connections
4. 🎯 **NAT traversal** - Test on different network types
5. 🎯 **Content sync** - Verify file chunk distribution works
6. 🎯 **Connection monitoring** - Add quality metrics and health checks

### Priority 2: Phase 6.2 - P2P Credit Flow
1. 🎯 **Tipping system** - Separate from Hype, custom amounts
2. 🎯 **Credit gifting** - Send credits with messages
3. 🎯 **Transaction notifications** - Alert users of received credits
4. 🎯 **Credit leaderboards** - Top earners and contributors
5. 🎯 **Rate limiting** - Prevent transaction spam
6. 🎯 **Credit analytics** - Charts and insights

### Simulation & Integration Coverage

| Scenario | Status | Coverage Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Conflicting credit transactions** | 🟡 Script design complete | Harness planned for simultaneous hype burns, P2P transfers, and signup rewards hitting the ledger; awaiting automation in swarm simulator. |
| **Ledger desynchronization & recovery** | 🟡 In progress | Recovery coordinator flow mapped from `ARCHITECTURE.md`; needs scripted fragment drop/resync sequence with quorum arbitration assertions. |
| **Handle claim conflict journeys** | 🔴 Not started | UI storyboard variants enumerated in `WIREFRAME_OVERVIEW.md`; requires backend-driven race to validate notifications and conflict resolution. |
| **Council adjudication replay protection** | 🔴 Not started | Gossip + signed payload replay matrix drafted; needs integration checks that rejected fragments stay quarantined across retries. |
| **Hosting credit accrual accuracy** | 🔴 Not started | Calculation stub tracked in Known Issues; simulation must cover varying uptime and bandwidth heuristics before enabling payouts. |

> ✅ = automated in CI, 🟡 = scripted/manual coverage underway, 🔴 = planned only
