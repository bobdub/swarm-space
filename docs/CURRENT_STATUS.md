## üìä Technical Metrics

### Code Stats
- **Total files:** ~40 (including shadcn/ui components)
- **Custom components:** 4 (Navigation, PostCard, ProjectCard, TaskBoard)
- **Pages:** 8
- **Core libraries:** 3 (crypto.ts, store.ts, auth.ts)
- **Lines of custom code:** ~1,200 (excluding ui components)

### Bundle Size (Estimated)
- **Vendor bundles:** ~200KB (React, React Router, Radix UI)
- **Custom code:** ~30KB
- **Total (gzipped):** ~80KB

### Browser Support
- ‚úÖ Chrome 88+ (Web Crypto API, IndexedDB)
- ‚úÖ Firefox 89+ (Web Crypto API, IndexedDB)
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+ (Web Crypto API, IndexedDB)
- ‚úÖ Edge 88+ (Chromium-based)
- ‚ùå IE11 (no Web Crypto, not supported)

## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue #1: Sample Data is Hardcoded
**Problem:** Index page shows hardcoded sample posts, not real data from IndexedDB.  
**Impact:** Can't test full create ‚Üí store ‚Üí display flow yet.  
**Fix:** Phase 1 Task 2.2 (Real Feed)

### Issue #2: No Storage Quota Monitoring
**Problem:** App doesn't warn when approaching IndexedDB quota.  
**Impact:** Could fail silently on large uploads.  
**Fix:** Add `navigator.storage.estimate()` checks in Phase 1.

### Issue #3: No Error Boundaries
**Problem:** Crypto errors or storage failures crash entire app.  
**Impact:** Poor UX on errors.  
**Fix:** Wrap pages in React error boundaries (Phase 1).

### Issue #4: Key Generation Blocks UI
**Problem:** Generating keys on main thread freezes UI for ~200ms.  
**Impact:** Noticeable lag on account creation.  
**Fix:** Move crypto to Web Worker (Phase 6 optimization).

## üîí Security Status

### Implemented
- ‚úÖ ECDH key generation (P-256, considered secure)
- ‚úÖ AES-GCM encryption (256-bit, authenticated)
- ‚úÖ PBKDF2 key derivation (200k iterations, meets OWASP recommendation)
- ‚úÖ Random IVs for each encryption operation (prevents IV reuse)
- ‚úÖ Private key wrapping (passphrase-protected storage)

### Not Yet Implemented
- [ ] Content signatures (Ed25519 for provenance)
- [ ] Key rotation (no mechanism yet)
- [ ] Secure key deletion (overwrite memory)
- [ ] Rate limiting on passphrase attempts
- [ ] Certificate pinning (future for relay servers)

### Security Audit Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not audited:** Crypto implementation needs professional review before public launch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Self-review only:** No third-party security audit yet
- ‚úÖ **Best practices:** Following OWASP, NIST guidelines

- ‚úÖ Responsive design (mobile viewports work)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not optimized for touch interactions yet

### Mobile Web (PWA)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No PWA manifest yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No service worker for offline

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (Sprint 1)

1. **Implement file encryption module** (`src/lib/fileEncryption.ts`)
   - Functions: `genFileKey`, `chunkAndEncryptFile`, `decryptAndReassembleFile`
   - Test with various file sizes (1MB, 10MB, 100MB)

2. **Build FileUpload component** (`src/components/FileUpload.tsx`)
   - Drag-and-drop zone
   - Progress indicators
   - File type validation

3. **Create Files page** (`src/pages/Files.tsx`)
   - List all manifests
   - Preview/download functionality
   - Delete with storage reclaim

4. **Enhance Create page**
   - Integrate FileUpload
   - Store posts with manifest references

5. **Load real feed data**
   - Update Index page to read from IndexedDB
   - Replace sample data with real posts
