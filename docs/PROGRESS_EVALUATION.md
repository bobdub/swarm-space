## Critical Gaps Identified

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY GAPS

#### 1. **Feed is Still Mock Data**
- **Issue:** Index page shows hardcoded sample posts
- **Impact:** Users can create posts but can't see their own content
- **Blocker:** Core user experience broken
- **Fix Required:** Load real posts from IndexedDB, display actual file attachments

#### 2. **Post Creation Doesn't Save**
- **Issue:** Create page has UI but doesn't persist posts to IndexedDB
- **Impact:** Created posts disappear
- **Blocker:** Content creation loop incomplete
- **Fix Required:** Implement post storage with manifest references

#### 3. **No Post-Manifest Connection**
- **Issue:** Posts have `manifestIds` field but no decrypt/display logic
- **Impact:** File attachments invisible in feed
- **Blocker:** Rich media posts don't work
- **Fix Required:** Decrypt and render attachments in PostCard

#### 4. **Project System Not Functional**
- **Issue:** ProjectCard exists but no creation flow or detail pages
- **Impact:** Can't create or manage projects
- **Blocker:** Project-scoped features unusable
- **Fix Required:** Project creation modal + detail page + member management

#### 5. **Task System Disconnected**
- **Issue:** TaskBoard is presentational only
- **Impact:** Can't create, edit, or persist tasks
- **Blocker:** Task management non-functional
- **Fix Required:** Task CRUD operations + IndexedDB persistence

#### 6. **Planner is Empty Shell**
- **Issue:** Planner page is placeholder
- **Impact:** No milestone/calendar functionality
- **Blocker:** Project planning impossible
- **Fix Required:** Calendar component + milestone creation/editing

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS

#### 7. **File Key Persistence Missing**
- **Issue:** File encryption keys need secure storage
- **Impact:** Can't decrypt files after page reload (potential)
- **Mitigation Needed:** Wrap file keys with user's master key

#### 8. **No Storage Quota Monitoring**
- **Issue:** Browser IndexedDB limits not tracked
- **Impact:** App may fail silently when quota exceeded
- **Mitigation:** Add quota check + warning UI

#### 9. **No Post Interactions**
- **Issue:** Like/comment/share buttons are placeholders
- **Impact:** Limited social engagement
- **Enhancement:** Add interaction persistence + counts

#### 10. **Search Not Implemented**
- **Issue:** Explore page has no search functionality
- **Impact:** Content discovery limited
- **Enhancement:** Full-text search across posts/projects

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY GAPS

#### 11. **No User Profiles**
- `/u/:username` route not implemented
- Profile editing not available

#### 12. **No Notifications System**
- Notifications page is placeholder
- No activity tracking

#### 13. **No Multi-Device Sync**
- Single device only
- No sync queue for offline changes

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: Complete Phase 1 First (Recommended)
**Rationale:** Fix critical UX gaps before adding new features

1. **Sprint 2 (1-2 days):** Rich Posts & Feed
   - Implement post saving to IndexedDB
   - Load real posts on Index page
   - Display decrypted file attachments
   - Add post filtering (All/Images/Videos/Docs)
   - Basic trending algorithm

2. **Sprint 3 (2-3 days):** Project Management
   - Project creation flow
   - Project detail page with tabs
   - Project-scoped posts
   - Member management UI

3. **Then ‚Üí Phase 2:** Planner & Tasks (fully functional base)

### Option B: Parallel Development (Risky)
Move to Phase 2 while Phase 1 gaps exist
- **Pros:** Faster feature breadth
- **Cons:** Fragmented UX, technical debt, harder debugging

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Pragmatic)
Fix critical blockers + start Phase 2
1. **Immediate (today):** Fix post persistence + feed loading
2. **Parallel:** Start Phase 2 planner/tasks
3. **Later:** Complete project management features

---

## Phase 2 Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Ready for Phase 2:
- Data models (Task, Milestone) defined
- TaskBoard component exists (needs backend)
- Planner page scaffold exists
- Storage layer ready
- User authentication works

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers for Phase 2:
- Tasks need CRUD operations + IndexedDB integration
- Planner needs calendar component (can use react-big-calendar or date-fns)
- No project context to scope tasks/milestones
- Need drag-and-drop library (react-beautiful-dnd or @dnd-kit)

### üéØ Phase 2 Prerequisites:
1. Projects must be creatable (Phase 1 Sprint 3)
2. Post system should work (Phase 1 Sprint 2) for project feeds
3. Decision: Build planner independent of projects OR make it project-scoped?

## Proposed Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Phase 1 Complete? | Phase 2 Start? | Risk Level |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| **A: Sequential** | ‚úÖ Sprint 2+3 first | üîÑ After Phase 1 | üü¢ Low |
| **B: Skip Phase 1** | ‚ùå Leave gaps | ‚úÖ Start now | üî¥ High |
| **C: Critical Path** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix post/feed only | ‚úÖ Start planner | üü° Medium |

---

## Recommendation: **Option C - Critical Path**

### Immediate Actions (This Session):
1. ‚úÖ Fix post creation ‚Üí save to IndexedDB
2. ‚úÖ Fix feed loading ‚Üí read from IndexedDB  
3. ‚úÖ Fix file attachment display ‚Üí decrypt in PostCard
4. ‚úÖ Start Phase 2: Planner calendar component
5. ‚úÖ Start Phase 2: Enhanced TaskBoard with persistence

### Next Session:
- Complete project creation flow
- Add task assignment + due dates
- Link milestones to tasks
- Implement drag-and-drop

### Why This Works:
- Unblocks core user loop (create ‚Üí see content)
- Phase 2 can develop in parallel
- Tasks/planner don't strictly need projects initially (can be personal)
- Projects can be layered in later as scoping mechanism

## Success Metrics for Phase 2 Entry

Before declaring Phase 2 "started", we must have:
- [x] Users can create accounts ‚úÖ
- [x] Users can upload encrypted files ‚úÖ
- [ ] Users can create posts with files **‚Üê FIX NOW**
- [ ] Users can view their posts in feed **‚Üê FIX NOW**
- [ ] File attachments render in posts **‚Üê FIX NOW**
- [ ] Users can create tasks (Phase 2)
- [ ] Users can create milestones (Phase 2)

## Next Sprint Plan

### Phase 1.5 + Phase 2 Hybrid Sprint (3-4 days)

#### Day 1: Critical Fixes
- Implement post persistence (Create page)
- Load real posts on Index page
- Render file attachments in PostCard with decryption

#### Day 2: Enhanced Task System
- Task CRUD modal
- Task persistence to IndexedDB
- Drag-and-drop kanban (react-beautiful-dnd)
- Task filtering + search

#### Day 3: Planner/Calendar
- Install date library (react-big-calendar or build custom)
- Month/week calendar view
- Milestone creation modal
- Milestone scheduling

#### Day 4: Integration
- Link tasks to milestones
- Project context for tasks (optional)
- Offline change queue foundation
- Testing + bug fixes

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Error Handling:** Add try-catch blocks to crypto operations
2. **Loading States:** Add skeletons for async operations
3. **Validation:** Add form validation to Create/Settings pages
4. **TypeScript:** Fix any remaining `any` types
5. **Performance:** Consider Web Workers for large file encryption
6. **Testing:** Add unit tests for crypto/storage modules

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should tasks be personal or project-scoped initially?**
   - Personal = easier, faster to build
   - Project-scoped = more useful, aligns with vision

2. **Calendar library or custom build?**
   - react-big-calendar = feature-rich, heavy
   - react-day-picker = lightweight, more work
   - Custom = full control, most work

3. **Drag-and-drop library?**
   - react-beautiful-dnd = popular, maintained
   - @dnd-kit = modern, better performance
   - Native HTML5 = lightweight, more work

4. **Sync strategy for offline edits?**
   - Change queue with timestamps
   - CRDT for conflict-free merging
   - Last-writer-wins with version vectors

---

## Summary

**Current State:** Phase 1 Sprint 1 complete, but critical UX gaps exist.

**Recommended Path:** Fix post creation/loading (1 day) ‚Üí Start Phase 2 in parallel.

**Phase 2 Scope:** Functional planner + task system with persistence.

**Target:** Working prototype with full offline content + planning tools in 3-4 days.

**Next Action:** Implement post persistence + feed loading, then proceed to Phase 2 task/planner enhancements.
