## Current Gaps Analysis

### üü¢ MINOR GAPS (Non-Blocking)

#### 1. **Notifications System**
- **Status:** In progress - needs completion
- **Impact:** Users can't see interaction activity
- **Priority:** High for Phase 3 Sprint 2 completion
- **Required:** Notification creation on reactions/comments, display, marking as read

#### 2. **Avatar Image Display**
- **Status:** Avatar upload works, display needs testing/refinement
- **Impact:** Limited visual profile representation
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Required:** Decrypt and display avatar images from file refs

#### 3. **Notification Badge**
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Impact:** No visual indicator of new activity
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Required:** Unread count badge on navigation bell icon

### üü° DEFERRED FEATURES (Future Phases)

#### 4. **Project Management Features**
- **Status:** Basic ProjectCard exists, no creation flow
- **Impact:** Can't create or manage projects
- **Priority:** Phase 4
- **Deferred:** Full project system with member management, project-scoped content

#### 5. **Search & Discovery**
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Impact:** Limited content discovery
- **Priority:** Phase 3 Sprint 3
- **Required:** Full-text search, tag system, trending tags

#### 6. **Credit/Hype System**
- **Status:** Planned but not designed yet
- **Impact:** Alternative trending mechanism needed
- **Priority:** Post-MVP
- **Future:** User credits for trending posts, P2P creator support

#### 7. **Storage Quota Monitoring**
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Impact:** App may fail silently when quota exceeded
- **Priority:** Low
- **Enhancement:** Quota check + warning UI

#### 8. **Multi-Device Sync**
- **Status:** Foundation in place (sync queue)
- **Impact:** Single device only currently
- **Priority:** Phase 5 (P2P networking)
- **Future:** WebRTC-based sync between user's devices

## Recommended Path Forward

### Current Sprint: Complete Phase 3 Sprint 2 ‚úÖ
**Rationale:** Finish social interactions for MVP-ready social features

1. **Immediate (Today):** Notifications System
   - Create notification data model
   - Generate notifications on reactions/comments
   - Build notifications page with list view
   - Add unread count badge to navigation
   - Mark notifications as read functionality

2. **Next (1-2 days):** Avatar Display & Polish
   - Test and refine avatar image decryption
   - Add loading states for avatar images
   - Default avatar generation (initials)

## Technical Debt to Address

1. ‚úÖ ~~Error Handling~~ - Implemented in crypto operations
2. ‚úÖ ~~Loading States~~ - Added to FileUpload, FilePreview
3. ‚è≥ **Form Validation** - Needs expansion in Create/Profile forms
4. ‚úÖ ~~TypeScript~~ - Minimal `any` types remain
5. ‚è≥ **Performance** - Consider Web Workers for large file encryption (future)
6. ‚è≥ **Testing** - Add unit tests for crypto/storage modules (future)
7. ‚è≥ **Comment Deletion** - Currently soft-deletes, needs proper implementation
8. ‚è≥ **Post Comment Association** - Comments need postId field for filtering

## Open Questions (Resolved)

1. ~~**Should tasks be personal or project-scoped initially?**~~
   - ‚úÖ **Decision:** Personal tasks for now, project scoping in Phase 4

2. ~~**Calendar library or custom build?**~~
   - ‚úÖ **Decision:** date-fns with custom calendar component

3. ~~**Drag-and-drop library?**~~
   - ‚úÖ **Decision:** @dnd-kit (implemented)

4. ~~**Sync strategy for offline edits?**~~
