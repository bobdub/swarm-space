# 🌟 Swarm Achievements & Quantum Creator Metrics (QCM)

> **Status:** Concept only. This document captures future-facing ideas for achievements and QCM visuals. The systems described below are _not_ implemented yet and should not be treated as commitments until they appear in the roadmap and course-of-action plan.

Where uptime meets creativity — and every action **earns credits** and **influences your QCM chart**.

---

## 🧭 Welcome to the System

Every action you take in the swarm — posting, hosting, hyping, or helping — leaves a mark.  
**Achievements** are digital trophies celebrating skill, creativity, and community support.  

**Quantum Creator Metrics (QCM)** translate all your contributions into a **dynamic activity chart**, showing spikes when you shine and dips during inactivity.  

Each badge earned also comes with **Credits**, our internal currency — trade, tip, or hype projects — giving your influence **visible power in the network**.

> 🌀 Contribute, engage, host, and watch both your badges and QCM chart grow.
