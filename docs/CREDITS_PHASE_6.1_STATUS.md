## 🐛 Known Issues (Revalidated 6.1)

1. **Hosting Credits Stub**: `awardHostingCredits()` grants 1 credit/MB but lacks trigger wiring (deferred to Phase 6.3).
2. **Notification Surfacing**: Credit event stream exists, but no global toast/feed listener yet.
3. **Rate Limit Scope**: Limits are device-local; shared-account abuse mitigation still pending.
4. **Genesis Credits Loophole**: Could be re-awarded if balance record cleared (low priority).

---

## 📌 Plan of Action (Unified Alignment)

1. **Surface Credit Event Notifications**
   - Attach global toast/feed listener to `credits:transaction` CustomEvents.
   - Provide per-user digest (badge + recent activity module).
   - Document the notification pipeline in `Unified_Source_of_Truth.md`.

2. **Harden Rate Limiting**
   - Evaluate cross-device synchronization options (IndexedDB sync, peer attestations).
   - Add developer tooling to inspect rate-limit state + reset utilities for QA.
   - Define escalation path for abuse detection metrics.

3. **Deliver Phase 6.2 Metrics Surfaces**
   - Design credit leaderboards (top earners, top tippers) with filtering.
   - Prototype credit analytics charts leveraging `postMetrics` aggregates.
   - Align UI with product/brand (docs + Figma sync).

4. **Regression & QA Expansion**
   - Re-run onboarding & tipping flows with updated genesis numbers.
   - Capture new manual test cases (tip min/max, rate limit exhaust, message persistence).
   - Schedule automation tickets for tipping + notifications.

---

## 🚀 Phase 6.2 Kickoff Progress

- ✅ Introduced `tipUser` API and tip mode inside `SendCreditsModal` with optional messages.
- ✅ Implemented local transfer rate limits (5 tx/min, 5k credits/day) with user feedback.
- ✅ Broadcast `credits:transaction` CustomEvents for downstream notification surfaces.
- ✅ Profile page now listens for credit events to refresh displayed balances automatically.
- ✅ Account setup flow + copy updated to new 100-credit genesis allocation.

2. ✅ **Credit Gifting** - Optional messages stored on transfers
3. ⚙️ **Transaction Notifications** - Event bus live; UI surface pending
4. ⏸️ **Credit Leaderboards** - Design & data hooks to define
5. ⚙️ **Rate Limiting** - Device-local guard; distributed sync pending
6. ⏸️ **Credit Analytics** - Charts and insights on credit activity
