## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Hosting Credits Stub**: `awardHostingCredits()` exists but not triggered (needs P2P integration)
2. **No Transaction History UI**: Users can't view past transactions yet
3. **Balance Not Reactive**: Profile credit display doesn't auto-update after transactions
4. **No Credit Limits**: Users could theoretically accumulate infinite credits
5. **Genesis Credits Loophole**: Could be re-awarded if balance record cleared

---

## 🎯 Next Immediate Tasks (Phase 6.1 Completion)

1. **Create CreditHistory component**
   - Display transaction list with filters
   - Show incoming/outgoing/burned separately
   - Link transactions to posts/users

2. **Add Credit Balance to Navigation**
   - Small badge showing current balance
   - Click to open transaction history
   - Real-time updates

3. **Implement Hosting Reward Trigger**
   - Hook into file storage events
   - Track bytes hosted per user
   - Award credits based on storage contribution

4. **Fix Balance Reactivity**
   - Use state management or event system
   - Update profile display after transactions
   - Consider React Context for credit state

5. **Add Credit Limits & Safety**
   - Implement daily earning caps
   - Add transaction rate limiting
   - Prevent genesis credit re-award
