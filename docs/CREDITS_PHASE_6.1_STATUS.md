## üìä Implementation Metrics

| Category | Progress | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Data Models | 100% | Core types complete |
| Database Schema | 100% | IndexedDB v6 deployed |
| Core Functions | 95% | Genesis reward value needs retuning |
| Security | 85% | Self-transfer guard incomplete |
| UI Components | 85% | Cross-profile balance display missing |
| Integration | 95% | Auto-rewards live, visibility regression open |
| Testing | 60% | Manual testing expanded; regressions pending fixes |

**Overall Phase 6.1 Completion: 90% (QA rework in progress)**

---

## üêõ Known Issues (Revalidated 6.1)

1. **Cross-Profile Balance Visibility**: Users only see their own balance; other profiles lack credit totals.
2. **Self-Transfer Bypass**: Profile action banner allows sending credits to self despite modal validation.
3. **Genesis Credits Tuning**: Reduce signup reward from 1000 ‚Üí 100 credits to fit economic plan.
4. **Hosting Credits Stub**: `awardHostingCredits()` grants 1 credit/MB but lacks trigger wiring (deferred to Phase 6.3).
5. **Rate Limiting**: No transaction rate limiting yet (deferred to Phase 6.2).
6. **Genesis Credits Loophole**: Could be re-awarded if balance record cleared (low priority).

---

## üìå Plan of Action (Unified Alignment)

1. **Adjust Genesis Credit Configuration**  
   - Update `CREDIT_REWARDS.GENESIS` in `src/lib/credits.ts` from 1000 ‚Üí 100.  
   - Verify onboarding flow (`AccountSetupModal`) reflects the lower starting balance and adjust copy/tooltips.  
   - Migrate existing balances via an IndexedDB patch (deduct 900 legacy credits where applicable).

2. **Restore Cross-Profile Balance Visibility**  
   - Inspect `ProfileBanner` / related profile components for remote balance queries using `getCreditBalanceRecord`.  
   - Extend `useCreditBalance` (or add a read-only variant) to fetch other users' balances safely.  
   - Add regression coverage for viewing another profile per Unified Source of Truth requirements.

3. **Enforce Self-Transfer Protection Everywhere**  
   - Align profile action banner validation with `SendCreditsModal` guards.  
   - Add tests preventing self-targeting across all entry points.  
   - Document safeguards in `docs/Unified_Source_of_Truth.md`.

4. **Reconfirm Phase 6.1 Test Coverage**  
   - Expand manual checklist with cross-profile and negative transfer cases.  
   - Schedule automation tasks for credit visibility and self-transfer.  
   - Once fixes land, update Unified Source of Truth + status metrics and re-close Phase 6.1.
