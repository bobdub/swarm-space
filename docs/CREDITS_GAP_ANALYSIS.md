## 🚧 Partially Implemented

### Credit Data Models (80%)
**Implemented:**
- Basic CreditBalance with balance, totalEarned, totalSpent, totalBurned

- ❌ `lifetimeEarned` vs just `totalEarned`
- ❌ `arcHash` field on transactions (blockchain integration)
- ❌ `prevHash` field for hash chaining

3. Daily earning caps
4. Better transaction metadata

### Nice-to-Have for Phase 6.1
1. Credit analytics
2. Hosting stats display

## 🔄 Whitepaper Deviations

### Intentional Simplifications
1. **Combined Credits**: No node/content split yet (defer to Phase 6.3)
2. **Higher Genesis**: 1000 vs 100 (better UX for testing)
3. **Higher Rewards**: 10 vs 1 per post (more engaging)
4. **No Arc Ledger**: Deferred to Phase 6.4
5. **No Q-Consensus**: Deferred to Phase 6.5

**Rationale:** Progressive implementation allows testing core mechanics before adding complexity.

### Unintentional Gaps
1. **No engagement rewards** - Should be added to Phase 6.1
2. **No rate limiting** - Security risk, needs immediate fix
3. **No hosting triggers** - Acceptable for now (no P2P yet)
4. **Missing transaction history UI** - Poor UX without this

---

## ✅ Next Actions

1. Review this gap analysis with team/users
2. Prioritize remaining Phase 6.1 features
3. Create tickets for high-priority gaps
4. Update implementation plan with realistic timelines
5. Begin Phase 6.1 completion sprint
