# Streaming Implementation Assessment

## Summary
- Established a live `StreamingContext` that fulfills the Milestone 1 wiring described in the implementation plan by connecting REST endpoints, WebSocket updates, and provider bootstrapping.
- Added typed streaming API helpers so feature work can call the planned `/api/signaling/rooms*` and `/api/streams/*` endpoints consistently.
- Documented remaining gaps for later milestones covering UI entry points, feed promotion, recordings, and observability.

## Current Scaffolding Snapshot
- **Context provider:** `src/contexts/StreamingContext.tsx` now manages connection lifecycle, room state, and moderation helpers instead of returning an offline placeholder.
- **Types:** `src/types/streaming.ts` expands shared interfaces to include join responses, recording toggles, and socket message envelopes used by the context.
- **API utilities:** `src/lib/streaming/api.ts` centralizes fetch logic for creating, joining, moderating, and promoting rooms.
- **Consumer hook:** `src/hooks/useStreaming.ts` continues to expose the context; existing UI such as `VideoRoomModal` can now receive live state updates.

## Alignment with Streaming-Implementation-Plan
| Milestone Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Streaming context managing rooms, signaling connectivity, and moderation flags【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L26-L37】 | ✅ Implemented via reducer-driven provider wiring WebSocket + REST calls.【F:src/contexts/StreamingContext.tsx†L1-L410】 |
| Shared streaming types under `src/types/streaming.ts`【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L29-L30】 | ✅ Extended with join responses, recording toggles, and socket message schema.【F:src/types/streaming.ts†L1-L86】 |
| `useStreaming` hook wrapping the context【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L31-L33】 | ✅ Existing hook works with the new provider behaviour (no changes required). |
| Feature flag & provider wiring in `App.tsx`【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L34-L36】 | ✅ Environment flag handled inside the provider; `App.tsx` already wraps the tree so no additional changes were necessary.【F:src/contexts/StreamingContext.tsx†L62-L92】 |
| REST + WebSocket lifecycle coverage | ✅ REST helpers created for create/join/leave/promote/moderate/record; WebSocket handler reconciles room updates and deletions.【F:src/lib/streaming/api.ts†L1-L145】【F:src/contexts/StreamingContext.tsx†L193-L310】 |

## Outstanding Gaps vs. Plan
- **UI entry points:** Profile/project composers still lack “Start live room” actions and room trays (Milestone 2).【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L38-L47】
- **Feed integration:** No logic yet to publish or render live-room posts (Milestone 3).【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L49-L55】
- **Recording hooks:** Client toggles call the API but no replay UI or polling is implemented (Milestone 4).【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L57-L64】
- **Observability:** Telemetry and resilience behaviours remain to be wired after the UX layers (Milestone 5).【F:docs/Streaming-Implementation-Plan.md†L66-L72】

## Next Steps
1. Integrate streaming entry points into profile and project creation flows, wiring `StreamingContext.createRoom` and `joinRoom` into the existing UI components.
2. Build the room tray component that consumes `roomsById` and `activeRoom` to surface participant/mute/ban controls.
3. Implement feed post promotion UI using `promoteRoomToPost`, and render live/replay cards once `toggleRecording` begins returning assets.
4. Add telemetry hooks and reconnection indicators in the tray to satisfy observability requirements.
