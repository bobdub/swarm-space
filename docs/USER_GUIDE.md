# Welcome to Swarm Space

## Your Offline-First Social Project Builder

Swarm Space is a revolutionary platform that puts **you** in control of your data, projects, and collaborations. Unlike traditional social networks and project tools, everything you create belongs to you—stored locally on your device and shared directly with peers, without trusting a central server.

---

## 🌟 What Makes Swarm Space Special?

### Own Your Data
Everything you create—posts, projects, files, messages—is stored **on your device**. No company owns your content. No servers can shut down and take your work with them.

### Work Offline
Lost internet connection? No problem. Swarm Space works perfectly offline. Create posts, manage tasks, and organize projects. When you reconnect, everything syncs automatically with your network.

### True Privacy
All your content is **end-to-end encrypted**. Even if someone intercepts your data, they can't read it. Only you and the people you choose to share with can see your content.

### Peer-to-Peer Networking
Connect directly with other users through our intelligent mesh network. No central server means no single point of failure, censorship, or surveillance.

## 🌐 Understanding the P2P Network

### How Connections Work

Swarm Space uses a **hybrid multi-transport architecture**:

1. **WebRTC DataChannels**: Direct peer-to-peer connections
2. **Gun.js Mesh**: Relay network for difficult NAT scenarios
3. **WebTorrent DHT**: Automatic peer discovery
4. **PeerJS Signaling**: Stable cloud-assisted fallback

The app **automatically** chooses the best connection method. You don't need to configure anything!

### Auto-Connect Peers

The network includes stable "bootstrap" peers that help you connect:
- Always online
- High reliability
- Help discover other peers

### Connection Health

Watch the **P2P status indicator** (top right):
- 🟢 Green: Connected to peers
- 🟡 Yellow: Connecting...
- 🔴 Red: Disconnected (offline mode)

Even when disconnected, you can still create content—it syncs when you reconnect.

### Node Dashboard (Advanced)

Power users can access **Settings** → **"Node Dashboard"** to:
- View all connected peers
- Monitor connection health
- Configure signaling servers
- Block unwanted peers
- View mesh topology

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I can't connect to peers"
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure browser allows WebRTC
- Try refreshing the page
- Check P2P status in Settings

### "My posts aren't syncing"
- Wait a few moments—syncing can take time
- Check if you're connected to any peers
- Posts sync automatically when peers connect

### "Wallet shows 0 SWARM but I have credits"
- **Credits ≠ SWARM**: You must **wrap** credits to convert them
- Go to Wallet → Credit Wrapping
- Check if rewards pool has balance

### "Profile token deployment failed"
- Ensure you have 1,000 SWARM for deployment cost
- Make sure token name is unique
- Try refreshing and redeploying

### "Can't wrap credits"
- Rewards pool may be empty
- Wait for mining rewards to fill the pool
- Or donate SWARM to the pool yourself

### "Lost my identity/keys"
- If you exported your recovery phrase: Import it in Settings
- If you didn't: Unfortunately, the identity is unrecoverable
- **Always backup your keys!**
