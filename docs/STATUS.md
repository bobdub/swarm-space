## Immediate Objectives
### Sprint 18 ‚Äì Social Surface Stabilization
1. Add post preview, filtering, and pagination to the home feed (`src/pages/Index.tsx`).

### Sprint 19 ‚Äì Connection Hardening
1. Implement connection request/approval flow with block controls in `PeerConnectionManager`.
2. Surface rendezvous mesh health (last sync, failures) and Ed25519 fallbacks in the UI.
3. Add diagnostics counters to `ConnectedPeersPanel` (failed dials, retries, bytes served).

### Sprint 20 ‚Äì Data Safety & Ops
1. Ship backup/quota reminders leveraging `src/lib/store.ts` metrics.
2. Build IndexedDB migration smoke tests and wire them into CI.
3. Publish self-hosted signalling guide and configuration instructions.
