Mini Task Planner

Purpose:

Provide small, actionable tasks that will evolve into complete project plans and be implemented seamlessly into the system.

Rules:

○ List project plans when created.

○ Check mark if project plan is completed.

1. Hype System

Objective:
Enhance promotional and trending algorithms to improve visibility accuracy and user engagement dynamics.

Tasks:

Rebuild trending metrics to prioritize total credits loaded per post, ensuring fairness and transparent promotion.

Implement a micro-burn algorithm tied to user activity (reactions, comments, shares) to balance engagement-based credit flow.

Remove deprecated pages and fallback routes to reduce server strain, eliminate redundant endpoints, and streamline frontend routing.


Expected Outcome:
A responsive, data-driven promotional system that reflects true engagement and value contribution.

2. Credit System Mathematics

Objective:
Establish mathematically sound credit logic for precise credit circulation and ecosystem balance.

Tasks:

Recalculate and verify conversion formulas for credit loading, burning, and redistribution.

Integrate real-time stability checks to detect anomalies, prevent overflows, and ensure transactional integrity.

Design and apply dynamic balancing equations to maintain systemic equilibrium and user fairness.


Expected Outcome:
A reliable, mathematically validated economy ensuring fairness and sustainability.

3. Security & Encryption Integrity

Objective:
Guarantee total compliance with encryption and security standards for all user-generated and system data.

Tasks:

Conduct security scans and penetration tests to assess vulnerabilities across systems and endpoints.

Verify encryption, salting, and chunking implementation for all media types (posts, images, videos, audio, streams).

Audit API security layers including token authentication, encryption keys, and data-at-rest protection under zero-trust architecture.


Expected Outcome:
A hardened, privacy-first system maintaining trust and data integrity throughout the ecosystem.

4. Stability & Structural Evaluation

Objective:
Reinforce platform reliability, scalability, and modular efficiency.

Tasks:

Perform comprehensive load and stress tests to identify weak points and optimize system resilience.

Evaluate architecture layers for scalability, modularity, and redundancy gaps.

Develop a structured improvement roadmap including refactor priorities, optimization checkpoints, and deployment milestones.


Expected Outcome:
A high-performance, scalable, and maintainable system foundation ready for continuous growth and innovation.
