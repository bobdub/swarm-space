## üåü Vision

**Imagination Network** reimagines digital collaboration as:
- **Local-first:** Your device is the source of truth
- **Encrypted by default:** Web Crypto API with AES-GCM + ECDH
- **Portable:** Export your identity and data anytime
- **Resilient:** Works offline, syncs when connected (future)
- **User-controlled:** You decide what to share, with whom, and how

---

## ‚ú® Current Features

### üîê Security & Identity
- **Local identity creation** with ECDH key pairs (P-256 curve)
- **Passphrase-protected keys** using PBKDF2 (200k iterations)
- **Account backup/restore** with encrypted export
- **File-level encryption** with unique AES-GCM keys per file
- **Content-addressed storage** (SHA-256 hashing for integrity)

### üìÅ File Management
- **Chunked encryption** (64KB chunks) for large files
- **Drag-and-drop upload** with real-time progress
- **File preview** for images, videos, PDFs
- **Encrypted storage** in IndexedDB
- **File attachment** support in posts

### üí¨ Social Features
- **Post creation** with text + multiple file attachments
- **Dynamic emoji reactions** with picker UI
- **Comment threads** on posts
- **User profiles** with avatars, bios, stats
- **Profile linking** from posts and comments
- **Notifications** (in progress)

### üìã Project Management
- **Kanban task board** with drag-and-drop (@dnd-kit)
- **Task CRUD** operations with full persistence

### üé® Design System
- **Dark theme** with deep indigo, cyan, and magenta accents
- **Shadcn/ui components** with custom variants
- **Responsive design** mobile-first
- **Smooth animations** and transitions

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Storage:** IndexedDB with custom wrapper
- **Crypto:** Web Crypto API (ECDH, AES-GCM, PBKDF2, SHA-256)
- **Routing:** React Router v6
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Drag-and-drop:** @dnd-kit
- **Date handling:** date-fns

### Core Principles
1. **Offline-first:** All features work without network
2. **Zero-knowledge:** No central server sees unencrypted data
3. **Content-addressed:** Files chunked and hashed for integrity
4. **Composable security:** Multiple encryption layers for different scopes

### Data Flow
```
User creates post with files
    ‚Üì
Generate unique file key (AES-GCM)
    ‚Üì
Chunk file (64KB) ‚Üí Encrypt each chunk ‚Üí Hash ciphertext
    ‚Üì
Store chunks + manifest in IndexedDB
    ‚Üì
Create post with manifest references
    ‚Üì
Display in feed with decrypted previews
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture.

## üîí Security

### Threat Model
- ‚úÖ Device theft (passphrase-protected keys)
- ‚úÖ Network eavesdropping (future P2P: DTLS encryption)
- ‚úÖ Data tampering (content-addressed integrity)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Browser compromise (malicious extensions can access memory)

### Mitigations
- Passphrase-protected private keys (PBKDF2 200k iterations)
- Unique IV per encryption operation
- Content hashing for integrity verification
- No plaintext storage of sensitive data
- Key export/import for device migration

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#security-threat-model](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#security-threat-model) for details.

## üåå Philosophy

> "Imagination is Creativity playing with Knowledge & Information!"

**Imagination Network** is more than a platform‚Äîit's a paradigm shift. We believe:
- Users should own their data, not rent it
- Privacy is a feature, not an afterthought
- Offline-first is resilience, not a limitation
- Decentralization is optional enhancement, not a requirement

The goal isn't to replace existing platforms. The goal is to prove that **users can own their data without sacrificing usability**.

---

**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è and quantum consciousness at the intersection of imagination and code.**

*To Infinity and beyond! |Œ®_Network‚ü©*
